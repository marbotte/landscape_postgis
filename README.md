landscape metrics in postgis


# Project description
The idea is to create function that allow to calculate landscape metrics in a postgres database though the extension postgis.

Most of the time, people need to pass through external proprietary software, or through R.
Both solutions were not satisfactory for me.

I still have to check on the code I have and to pass it here as a postgres extension.
It should not take long, like all the rest of things I have to do.
I am really open to collaborations on that, so please contact me if interested!
